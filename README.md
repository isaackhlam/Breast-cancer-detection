# Breast cancer detection

This is my first trail on Deep CNN network for abnormal detect about breast cancer.
The work is also my course project for SEEM 2460 Introduction for Data Science
The training script is quite messy and kinda unreadable
The project is in collaboration with two other students
I focus on the implementation, analysis and literature writing, while the others working on report writing and data visualization
Both paper works can be found in the docs folder

## Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the most frequent kinds of cancer in women across the
world. Mammography is a commonly used for early screening of breast cancer.
Calcification abnormality is early signal of breast cancer. However due to its nature,
many noise is presented in the mammography, a significant number of case are
misdiagnosed. In this work, we present a deep Convolutional Neural Network that
can be used to aid screening process without any prior annotation or segmentation
from clinic experts. Transfer learning was used to overcome inadequate training
data. We obtain satisfactory results on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, allowing for easy
and rapid application in real clinical data.
